# Description

This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack. Utilizing edge functions this app shortens links according to user slug input. I have used Nexxelns blog post as a method to help me learn tRPC, prisma, and TypeScript and have added my own modifications and features.
